I am a contractual associate professor working with DYLISS, an Irisa-Inria research team, at Universit√© de Rennes (France). My research topics are centered around machine learning, deep learning, interpretability, and graph signal processing with a particular interest for biomedical applications.

I previously worked on the [GraphNEx project](https://graphnex.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at ENS de Lyon (Univ. Lyon, France), where I investigated explainable machine learning approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying cellular processes.
