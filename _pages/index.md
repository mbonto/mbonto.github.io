I am a post-doctoral researcher working in the Molecular Biology (LBMC) and Physic (LP) Laboratories at ENS de Lyon (Univ Lyon, Lyon, France). My research topics are centered around machine learning, deep learning, interpretability, and graph signal processing with a particular interest for biomedical applications.

I am currently working for the [GraphNEx project](https://graphnex.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) where I try to develop explainable machine learning approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying cellular processes.
